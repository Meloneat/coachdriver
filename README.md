#content
Hi!l am Meloneat.You could call me 'melonman'.The project is about a idea of app that designed for 
the students will join in the Driving License Test.Though the test,l find many person could not f-
-igure out clearly their position while they are driving like reverse parking,lateral bearing test 
and etc.
So,l wanna design a software could show the coach car's position and virual the model in order to 
let the learner can correct their direction and improve their skills from the view.

#software design thinking
First,l will use the map API to realize some function:
1.location the learner
2.record how many parking places could be use and save the cm-level DT information
Second,use the app to build a model according to the coach car.Like AR.
